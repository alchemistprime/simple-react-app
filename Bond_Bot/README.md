# RasaDocker
A RASA NLU and RASA core tutorial project including docker containers for a more robust production type deployment.

This repository is built to follow along a blog tutorial that I created in order to each teach people these methods.  If you are interested in following the tutorial, you can read it here: [Smith Strategy](http://smithstrategy.com/index.php/2018/02/28/chatbot-tutorial-using-rasa-and-docker/)

Please leave me comments on my blog if you have questions or are confused about anything.
